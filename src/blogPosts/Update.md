It's been a while since I've updated the blog, as I haven't done much as I've thought of as being blog-worthy; alas - I don't want it to remain stagnant and I'd generally like to remain better about being active in documenting my adventures. 

I've been focusing on getting better with algorithms (as well as maths) by working through Project Euler/Codewar problems. I'm committed to providing solutions in both Python as well as Javascript to all problems I solve in Codewars, Python for Project Euler.

Coupizza is unfortunately dead in the water. With the changes to Facebook's API it's been rendered useless. It was a fantastic platform for honing my JS/React skills while it lasted. 

I plan on being far more active in Mozilla's open source community, namely debugger.html. I had issues with running it on my last laptop, but it's working well on my current machine.
