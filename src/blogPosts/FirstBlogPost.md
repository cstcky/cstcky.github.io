I've made this site to host my resume as well as document the process of building my first website (coupizza.com) and perhaps future projects I contribute to.

Coupizza is a pizza coupon finder that's filterable by zip code. Most larger coupon-finders pile all coupons from a merchant in one place, which makes finding location-based coupons a pain. Pizza is awesome, learning development is awesome, so I decided to dive into a somewhat niche idea while teaching myself programming.
